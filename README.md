## What is Ironverse? (Not yet implemented)

Ironverse is a decentralized peer-to-peer game hub. It runs any WASM game in the browser and allows it to run without a centralized server. This is done by establishing a peer-to-peer connection with other users of the same WASM, as well as giving it the ability to interact with blockchains.
